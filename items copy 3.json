After answering a few short questions, the new online tool will provide advice on the next steps for seeking treatment or care for a sick child. The Pediatric Symptom Checker is designed to help parents decide the best course of care for their child no matter where they are or what time it is says Brett Hutchinson MD pediatrician at Our Lady of the Lake Childrens Health. Our goal is to relieve some of the stress of parenting by making care accessible and easy to navigate. The symptom checker is designed to help parents and guardians decide on the appropriate care setting based on their childs symptoms and special circumstances. The tool is free for  everyone and available online. By answering a few quick, confidential questions, parents will be able to use this new resource to determine if they should go to the ER, contact a pediatrician immediately, make an appointment with a provider or seek another type of care.
